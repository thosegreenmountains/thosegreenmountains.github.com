            <p>Located in Underhill, Vermont, Mount Mansfield is the highest peak in Vermont. Many people don’t realize that this mountain has a face, that face has a chin and nose, and if you hike between the two you’ll be sure to find a mouth. Mount Mansfield is one of only three peaks in the state with alpine tundra. Don’t take a wrong step and smash the precious tundra or the peak troll will ream you out. The tundra has survived since the Ice Age so you know that it has seen some serious stuff and it’s delicate because of it. Mount Mansfield gets its name from the town of Mansfield, Vermont, which in 1848 was dissolved by Stowe because it proved too bad-ass for settlers to inhabit. If state of the art base lodges and 5 star hotels aren’t your thing, take a ride up the toll road and hike the famous Long Trail to the summit for a true taste of what Vermont is all about.</p>

            <p>Stratton Mountain stands as the highest point of Windham County, both literally and financially.</p>
            <p>It has served as quite the trend setter and launchpad for ideas since its forming 400 million years ago. In 1909, James P. Taylor conceived the idea of Vermont’s Long Trail, and during the trail’s construction, his friend Benton MacKaye came up with an even bigger trail that would extend from Georgia to Maine, the Appalachian Trail. No one likes a 1-upper, Benton. What a jerk.</p>
            <p>The mountain is also known for helping Jake Burton Carpenter give birth to a beautiful baby snowboard. He built his first board while living in nearby Manchester, and the Stratton Mountain Resort was the first major ski resort to openly accept snowboarders.</p>
            <p>With its Stratton Mountain Security, this mountain is considered the most legit in all of Vermont. They also have the Winhall Police Department who patrols in Ford Expeditions &amp; Honda Pilots, so you better be on your best behaviour while partaking in activities on this majestic beast.</p>
            <p>Atop its summit sits a fire tower that’s open to the public to climb, and a small caretaker cabin that’s climb-at-your-own-risk. (The caretaker might not be pleased.)</p>
            <p>This mountain is rumored to actually be a monadnock, but we’re fairly certain that isn’t a thing. But if it is, Stratton is one hell of one of them.</p>

            <p>Jay Peak, located just five miles south of the Canadian border, is just about as close to the powder of the west as you’ll get on the Ice-coast, with an annual snowfall of 355 inches of fluff. The mountain is flanked on both sides by brothers of the same name, Big Jay to the southwest and North Jay Peak to the north.</p>

            <p>All of the Jays get their name from the town of Jay, in which the mountain is located. In turn, the town of Jay was named after John Jay (a revolutionary diplomat) for no apparent reason...</p>

            <p>The peak is accessed by the famous aerial tram, providing incredible views of both the US and Canada. However, the tram came as a cost. In order to construct the tram house at the top of the mountain, excavators had to shave off just the tip of the mountain.</p>
